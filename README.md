## How should manually added themes be added and formatted?

First, ensure the Themes directory exists in the expected location on your SD Card: 
- .userdata/shared/Aesthetics/Themes

Themes should be saved in a non-zip format with a top level directory indicating the name of the theme (Themes/YourCoolTheme).

Inside your theme directory, save your .png files inside directories indicating their intended purpose. Currently downloadable themes usually use:
- CollectionIcons
- SystemIcons
- ToolIcons
- CollectionWallpapers
- ListWallpapers
- SystemWallpapers

Also ensure your image files contain a system tag like (GB) matching the tags used in NextUI to benefit from console grouping.
